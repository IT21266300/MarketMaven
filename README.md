This project aims to tackle the issue of unfair pricing in Sri Lanka's wholesale fruit and vegetable markets by introducing a mobile application that calculates transport costs using the distance traveled and promotes fair and reasonable profits for all stakeholders involved. The current system sees farmers receiving low prices for their produce while sellers make significant profits, leading to high customer prices.
The proposed solution involves developing a mobile application that provides real-time market information to farmers and sellers, including pricing and demand data, promoting transparency and equitable pricing. The app will also integrate a feature that calculates transport costs based on the distance traveled, ensuring that all stakeholders receive fair compensation for their contributions.
The impact of the proposed solution is significant, as it not only promotes fair pricing and improved livelihoods for farmers but also ensures that customers receive better value for their money. Moreover, the solution will promote a more efficient and transparent market system, encouraging sustainable economic growth and development.
The project will involve extensive stakeholder engagement, including farmers, seller, and customers, to ensure the solution is tailored to their needs and aspirations. The proposed solution represents a significant step towards addressing unfair pricing in Sri Lanka's wholesale fruit and vegetable markets, promoting equitable economic development.
